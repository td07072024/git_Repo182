Both scientific names Bos taurus and Bos indicus were introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, with the latter used to describe humped cattle in China.[3]

The zebu was classified as a distinct species by Juliet Clutton-Brock in 1999,[8] but as a subspecies of the domestic cattle, Bos taurus indicus, by both Clutton-Brock and Colin Groves in 2004[9] and by Peter Grubb in 2005.[10] In 2011, Groves and Grubb classified it as a distinct species again.[11][failed verification]

The American Society of Mammalogists considers it part of the species Bos taurus in analogy to Sanga cattle (Bos taurus africanus Kerr, 1792).[2] The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature has not yet published a ruling on the classification of domestic derivatives and no scientific body advocates the abolition of the biological species concept for domestic animals.

Currently (2024s), it is not correct to describe Zebu animals as Bos taurus indicus, but rather as Bos indicus,[4] because they are a different species from Bos taurus. The extinct wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) population diverged into two distinct genetic strains: the humpless Bos taurus (taurine) and the humped Bos indicus (indicine or zebu).
