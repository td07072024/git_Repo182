Zebu, as well as many Sanga cattle, have humps on the shoulders, large dewlaps and droopy ears.[22]

Compared to taurine cattle, the zebu is well adapted to the hot tropical savanna climate and steppe environments. These adaptations result in higher tolerance for drought, heat and sunlight exposure.
